# Communication Plan
How will your group communicate with each other ?  What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to ?  Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety, as we learned about in the article on Google and teams from Class 14 ?

* Communication will happen over Slack or in person.
* Minor changes can be done individually.
* Medium changes need at least one other voice.
* Major changes need round-table discussion with all voices heard before decision is made.

* We will be nice.  Period.  Always nice.
* We will endeavor to get enough sleep during project week,
* 30 min limit on blocking issues - team members to be consulted first, then Allie/Michelle if help still needed.

# Conflict plan
What will your group do when it encounters conflict ?  What will your process be to resolve it ?

* We will remain nice.  
* We will use our words.  
* We will ask for other opinions to resolve blocking issues and we will remain respectful even in disagreement.
* Team vote w/out complaint.  If tie-break needed, flip a coin.  

# Work Plan
How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general ?  In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on “meaty“ problems.

* We will plan to use the issues section in GitHub.
* Mob programming to begin on day 1 till comfortable with code base.
* Check in w/team members BEFORE committing anything.
* Mob programming should take care of equal contribution concern and tasks will be taken by each team member from issues to be resolved.  No cherry-picking.  

# Git Process
What is your Git flow ?  How many people must review a PR ?  Who merges PRs ?

* Check in w/team members BEFORE committing anything.
* We will have a staging branch and each team member has a daily checkout branch for features.
* Protect Master.
* Minimum of 1 person to review PRs.  No merging of our own PRs.  

# Misc.
* Breaks - same timeframe as lecture — ~1 hour work = ~10min break.
* Internal standup time - 9:15am daily.
* Sleep daily.  
* Eat daily.  
* Shower when necessary — and that means no more than 2 days without water AND soap on the body.
